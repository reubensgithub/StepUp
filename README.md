<sup>1</sup>The Firebase backend is the only part of the system not stored in the project directory, rather it is managed via the Firebase console which is accessed via this website.  
<sup>2</sup>This is the only directory directly accessible from the browser, although JSX components are injected from the source code.  
<sup>3</sup>HTML index creates a root division in the website document onto which JavaScript index renders the React.js application.
